Hello World!

Welcome to my new personal website! This will act as a outlet for the random
project that my ADHD brain starts. Starting with some of what I learned from
setting up this website itself. 

I am currently pursuing a Masters in Computer Science, supervised by 
[Dr Ken Pu](http://db.science.uoit.ca/). My work focuses on text mining and
natural language processing queries in relational databases.

This site also host my resume and links to my profiles on other platforms.

Stay tuned for more,
<br>Andrei
